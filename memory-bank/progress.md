# Progress: Tesera

## Current Status
**Phase 1 COMPLETE. Phase 2 COMPLETE.**
Frontend dev server running at http://localhost:3000

## What Works

### ✅ Phase 1 – Foundation
- Memory Bank initialized (all 5 core files)
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui v4 + Framer Motion
- Tesera design system (brand tokens: warm indigo primary, calm neutrals, dark/light mode)
- Inter font, custom CSS utility classes (`gradient-text`, `hero-gradient`, `glow-border`, `glass-card`, `section-container`)
- Root layout with ThemeProvider + Sonner toasts
- **Landing Page** — 6 modular sections: Hero, Problem, Features (8 pillars), Pricing (4 plans), FAQ, CTA
- Responsive Navbar with sticky scroll-blur
- Footer with links
- Login page (company-first, no consumer accounts)
- Register page (company name first field)
- Backend scaffold: FastAPI main.py, requirements.txt, .env.example
- README.md documentation

### ✅ Phase 2 – Dashboard Shell
- Collapsible Sidebar (60 route group) with active-state routing
- Topbar with search, notifications badge, dark/light toggle, dynamic user avatar
- Dashboard layout (`(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) with full-height sidebar + scrollable main
- Dashboard Overview page: greeting, 4 StatCards, RecentOrders table, AIRecommendations card
- Reusable StatCard, RecentOrders, AIRecommendations components
- Placeholder pages for all 10 dashboard routes

### ✅ Phase 2.5 – Full Authentication System
- **Backend API (FastAPI)**: JWT-based auth, secure Bcrypt hashing, SQLite integration.
- **Database Schema**: `Company` and `User` models configured with `is_verified` flags.
- **Frontend Integration**: Hooked up `/login` and `/register` with live `fetch` API wrappers (`src/lib/auth.ts`).
- **Real Email SMTP**: Live automated email sender (`smtplib`) for Verification & Password Resets via `.env`.
- **Route Protection**: Unverified users are blocked from `/dashboard` and forcefully redirected to `/pending-verification`.
- **Auth UI Pages**: Added `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email`, and `/pending-verification` flows.

### ✅ Phase 2.6 – Branding & Re-styling
- **Color Palette Update**: Switched base theme to `#fa7f05` (Orange) for primary and `#35ada3` (Teal) for secondary.
- **Logo Integration (`next/image`)**: Completely replaced text-based logos with `logo.png` across all areas (Navbar, Footer, Sidebar, and Auth pages) with carefully adjusted max widths to accommodate horizontal layout.
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: Added `mini-logo.png` fallback that appears when the dashboard sidebar is collapsed.
- **Hero Enhancements**: Embedded large animated `mini-logo.png` into the Landing page hero section.
- **Backend Email Templates**: Restructured SMTP emails into modern HTML formats encapsulating the frontend's `logo.png` and `#fa7f05` brand color.
- **Landing Page Polish**: Upgraded the "Features" section by replacing default icons with high-quality custom illustrations (`object-contain`), transforming them into large, centered, modern UI cards with hover animations.

### ✅ Phase 2.7 – Full Turkish Localization
- **Landing Page**: Fully translated all static content to Turkish (Hero, Problem, Features, Pricing, FAQ, CTA, Footer).
- **Authentication Flow**: Translated all login, register, password reset, and email verification pages. Updated form labels, placeholders, and Sonner toast messages.
- **Backend Email Templates**: Localized the HTML bodies and subject lines for verification and password reset emails sent by FastAPI.
- **Dashboard & Components**: Translated the Sidebar, Topbar, page headers, tables (Recent Orders, Shipments, Inventory), and metric cards to Turkish.
- **Test Simulator**: Translated the entire Unified Test Simulator page and updated the `README.md` instructions accordingly.

## What's Left to Build

### 🚧 Phase 3 – Core Modules (Review & Refinement)
- [x] **ERD Verification**: Review existing Phase 3 models (Order, Inventory, Shipment) against the ERD.
- [x] **Backend & Mock Data**: Rebuilt SQLite tables to fully support multi-tenancy (`company_id`). Created a robust randomizing seed mechanism to prevent `IntegrityError` collisions.
- [x] **UI Consistency**: Standardized search and filter layouts across `/dashboard/orders`, `/dashboard/inventory`, and `/dashboard/shipments` into a single inline flex-row design.
- [x] **Inventory Management**: Upgraded `shadcn` Sheet to `ProductSheet` handling both "New Product" creation and "Edit Product". Added Edit/Delete icons to the Inventory table.
- [x] **Testing Simulators**:
    - Combined all testing tools into a **Unified Test Simulator** at `/dashboard/test`.
    - Features: Bulk Data Seeding, Random Product Generator, Random Shipment Generator, Order Simulator, Shipment Carrier interface, DB Clear (wipes all company inventory, orders, shipments, and AI chat history), and AI Chat Test with markdown rendering.
- [x] **Sidebar Enhancements**: Organized the sidebar into categorical groups (Core, Insights, Management, Dev Tools) with proper labels and updated icons (`FlaskConical` for testing).

### ✅ Phase 4 – AI Assistant (Grok + OpenRouter)
- [x] **Backend API**: `/api/v1/ai/chat` endpoint migrated to **Grok** (`grok-4.3`) primary with **OpenRouter** (`meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`) fallback. Robust error handling for 401/402/429 rate limit and quota exhaustion.
- [x] **LLM Provider Config**: Replaced `GEMINI_API_KEY` with `GROK_API_KEY`/`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `config.py` and updated `.env.example`.
- [x] **Chat History Persistence**: New SQLAlchemy models `AIConversation` + `AIMessage`. Backend endpoints: `GET /ai/conversations`, `GET /ai/conversations/{id}`, `DELETE /ai/conversations/{id}`. Messages saved to DB per conversation; full history sent to LLM context.
- [x] **Frontend Chat UI**: Full conversational chat interface at `/dashboard/ai-assistant` with starter prompts, message bubbles, loading states, and clear conversation button.
- [x] **Conversation Sidebar**: Left sidebar showing past conversations (title + timestamp), load-on-click, new conversation button, delete confirmation dialog.
- [x] **Markdown Rendering**: AI responses rendered via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` with Tailwind Typography (`prose`) support for headings, lists, code blocks, links, and tables.
- [x] **Layout Fix**: Chat area uses full viewport height (`h-full -m-6`) to eliminate extra top/bottom padding and scroll.
- [x] **Test Simulator Integration**: Added **Module 5 – YZ Asistanı Testi** to the Unified Test Simulator for quickly verifying the API connection without navigating away.
- [x] **Dashboard AI Recommendations**: `GET /ai/recommendations` endpoint queries LLM with current company data and returns 3 actionable recommendations (type, message, action). Frontend `AIRecommendations` component fetches live suggestions with loading state, refresh button, and static fallback on error. Action buttons are fully clickable and route to the relevant dashboard pages: *Sipariş Ver* → Inventory, *Siparişleri Hazırla* → Orders, *Gecikme Nedenini Gör* → Shipments.

### ✅ Phase 4 – Agent Workflow Builder
- [x] **Backend Database Models**: Created `Workflow` and `WorkflowStep` SQLAlchemy models with multi-tenancy support (`company_id`). Workflow includes trigger types (manual, scheduled, webhook, event) and trigger config. WorkflowStep includes step type, step config, name, description, and order.
