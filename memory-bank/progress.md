# Progress: Tesera

## Current Status
**Phase 1 COMPLETE. Phase 2 COMPLETE.**
Frontend dev server running at http://localhost:3000

## What Works

### ✅ Phase 1 – Foundation
- Memory Bank initialized (all 5 core files)
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui v4 + Framer Motion
- Tesera design system (brand tokens: warm indigo primary, calm neutrals, dark/light mode)
- Inter font, custom CSS utility classes (`gradient-text`, `hero-gradient`, `glow-border`, `glass-card`, `section-container`)
- Root layout with ThemeProvider + Sonner toasts
- **Landing Page** — 6 modular sections: Hero, Problem, Features (8 pillars), Pricing (4 plans), FAQ, CTA
- Responsive Navbar with sticky scroll-blur
- Footer with links
- Login page (company-first, no consumer accounts)
- Register page (company name first field)
- Backend scaffold: FastAPI main.py, requirements.txt, .env.example
- README.md documentation

### ✅ Phase 2 – Dashboard Shell
- Collapsible Sidebar (60 route group) with active-state routing
- Topbar with search, notifications badge, dark/light toggle, user avatar dropdown
- Dashboard layout (`(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) with full-height sidebar + scrollable main
- Dashboard Overview page: greeting, 4 StatCards, RecentOrders table, AIRecommendations card
- Reusable StatCard, RecentOrders, AIRecommendations components
- Placeholder pages for all 10 dashboard routes: orders, inventory, shipments, analytics, ai-assistant, workflows, notifications, integrations, team, settings

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 3
- [ ] Orders full page (list, search, filter, detail view)
- [ ] Inventory management (table, stock alerts, reorder)
- [ ] Shipments (tracking table, delay flags)

### Phase 4
- [ ] AI Assistant chat interface
- [ ] Agent workflow builder
- [ ] Notification center

### Phase 5
- [ ] Analytics charts (Recharts or similar)
- [ ] Insights dashboard

### Phase 6
- [ ] Docker Compose (frontend + backend + postgres + redis)
- [ ] CI/CD prep
- [ ] Final polish + onboarding flow

## Known Issues
- Lockfile warning in Next.js build (root lockfile conflict) — cosmetic, no action needed.
